<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a secret voting application from scratch, moving from initial requirements to a fully functional MVP. The initial phase focused on core features like meeting creation, participant approval, anonymous voting, real-time results, and an organizer dashboard. This was followed by implementing PDF report generation and automatic data deletion, crucial for the application's privacy requirements. The latter part of the trajectory has been entirely dedicated to developing a robust, simple, and self-contained deployment solution using Docker, addressing multiple dependency conflicts (MongoDB ,  npm, Craco frontend build issues) and ensuring the use of stable, non-deprecated versions. The AI engineer is iteratively refining the  script and associated Dockerfiles to guarantee a smooth, single-command deployment experience, validating each fix with tests and providing detailed instructions.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a secret voting application for assemblies. Key functionalities include:
1.  **Organizer Interface:** Create meetings with a unique ID, approve/reject participants, create polls with multiple options, manually launch/close polls, set optional timers for polls, and view real-time results for approved participants.
2.  **Participant Interface:** Join meetings using their name and meeting ID, await organizer approval, vote anonymously on active polls, and view poll results only after casting their vote.
3.  **Anonymity & Data Handling:** All votes must be completely anonymous, with no link between participants and their choices. All meeting data (participants, polls, votes) must be permanently deleted after the organizer downloads a final PDF report.
4.  **PDF Report:** The final report should include a list of approved participants and numerical/percentage results for each poll conducted during the meeting.
5.  **Deployment:** The application needs a robust, simple, and efficient deployment script for a VPS, specifically targeting a Ubuntu/Debian environment and providing clear instructions for setup, updates, and diagnostics. The deployment must be simple, quick, and functional post-installation, using stable and non-deprecated dependencies.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Real-time Communication:** Polling mechanism for live updates.
-   **PDF Generation:** Python's ReportLab for creating detailed reports.
-   **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose for isolated and consistent deployment.
-   **Web Server:** Nginx for reverse proxying and serving static files.
-   **Process Management:** Supervisor for managing backend and frontend services.
-   **UI Library:** Shadcn UI components for modern interface.
-   **Frontend Tooling:** Craco for React configuration.
-   **SSL:** Certbot for automatic HTTPS.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



**Detailed Directory Structure:**

-   
    -   : Lists Python dependencies (e.g., FastAPI, uvicorn, pymongo, reportlab).
    -   : The main FastAPI application. This file defines API endpoints for creating meetings, managing participants, creating and voting on polls, fetching real-time results, and generating/deleting data via the final PDF report. It handles database interactions and business logic.
        -   **Changes:** Initially set up core CRUD and real-time polling. Later modified to add PDF report generation logic (), participant and poll data collection for the report, and the  function to clear all associated data after report download.
    -   : Contains environment variables like  and .
    -   : Dockerfile for the FastAPI backend, optimized for production, using stable Python and installing dependencies.

-   
    -   : Node.js dependencies (React, Axios, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, date-fns, react-day-picker, craco) and scripts.
    -   : Tailwind CSS configuration for styling.
    -   : PostCSS configuration for Tailwind.
    -   : Contains  for API calls.
    -   : Static assets.
    -   : React source code.
        -   : Entry point of the React application.
        -   : Main React component, handling routing and core application logic. It contains the UI for organizers (meeting creation, participant approval, poll management, final report) and participants (joining meetings, voting). It makes API calls to the backend using .
            -   **Changes:** Initial setup for organizer/participant views and form handling. Later refactored to correctly trigger API calls for meeting creation, integrate the final report tab, and include  and  functionalities. Debugging involved ensuring  function calls and correct environment variable usage ().
        -   : Component-specific styles.
        -   : Global styles, including Tailwind base and utility classes, and custom CSS variables for themes.
        -   : Contains Shadcn UI components (e.g., , , , , ). These are critical for maintaining a modern and consistent UI.
    -   : Craco configuration for customizing Webpack/Babel.
    -   : Dockerfile for the React frontend, configured to use  and serve via Nginx, addressing npm dependency conflicts and caching.

-    (Root)
    -   : The single, robust, interactive deployment script. This script automates the entire process: system updates, Docker installation, cloning the Git repository, building Docker images for frontend and backend, configuring Nginx, setting up SSL with Certbot, and establishing  management commands. It incorporates fixes for common issues like MongoDB  and npm dependency conflicts.
    -   : Project documentation and simplified deployment instructions for the  script.

The architecture emphasizes clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend, with environment variables managing communication URLs to ensure flexibility and adherence to Kubernetes ingress rules (API routes prefixed with ). Dockerization aims for environment consistency across development and deployment.

<pending_tasks>
- The AI engineer is currently refining the  script to ensure it flawlessly handles frontend build processes, uses the most stable and non-deprecated versions of all dependencies (MongoDB, Node.js, Docker Compose, etc.), and provides a simple, robust, and efficient deployment experience.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was working on creating a single, robust, and simple deployment script () for the application on a VPS, specifically addressing persistent deployment failures. The most recent issue encountered was a failure during the frontend build process, specifically an Unknown command: "error"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help related to  and  versions, and potential  configuration issues within the Docker build.

The AI engineer has already taken the following steps:
1.  **Consolidated Deployment Scripts:** All previous ad-hoc deployment scripts (, , , , ) have been removed or merged into a single .
2.  **Updated :** The main README has been simplified and updated to contain only the instructions for the single  script.
3.  **Revised :** The frontend Dockerfile has been significantly revised to:
    *   Use Node.js 18 LTS.
    *   Include  during  to resolve dependency conflicts.
    *   Add a step to clean the npm cache.
    *   Ensure correct environment variables for the build.
    *   Explicitly use  (which, via , would invoke ) and optimize Nginx configuration for React Router.
    *   Confirmed  is present in  and  exists.
4.  **Backend Dockerfile:** An optimized  for the backend has also been created.
5.  **Dependency Version Verification:** The engineer confirmed the latest stable LTS versions for MongoDB (6.0), Node.js (18 LTS), and Docker Compose (2.20.2), ensuring the scripts use these.

The current state is that the AI engineer has rewritten the core deployment mechanisms to be more robust, addressing previous  and npm resolution errors, and is now confirming the use of the latest stable versions to prevent deprecated dependency issues. The primary goal is to provide a perfect and simple deployment experience.
